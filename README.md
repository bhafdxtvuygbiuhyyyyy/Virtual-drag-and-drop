# Virtual-drag-and-drop
In this project we will be using OpenCV to virtually drag a image and drop it at a different location. It will be further used for Virtual Mouse.
# Project Description
The project ‘Virtual Drag’ is a OpenCV based system. This will allow the user to virtually click and drag the pictures and items on the screen to other parts of the screen without use of mouse. The system will detect the hand landmarks on the palm, using those pin points and distance between the fingertips the system willbe able to perform the operation.

mediapipe
# CVZone:
This is a Computer vision package that makes its easy to run Image processing and AI functions. At the core it uses OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries.

It can be installed using "pip install cvzone"
# Mediapipe:
MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal (eg. video, audio, any time series data), cross platform (i.e Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines.

It can be installed using "pip install mediapipe"
